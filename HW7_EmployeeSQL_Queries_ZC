--1a. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
--1a. Notes: Optional limiter for query runtime. Runtime on 100 employees = 2.97sec. Est. Runtime using this method for full data set exceeds 2hrs.

SELECT emp_no, last_name, first_name, gender, (
	SELECT salary FROM salaries WHERE salaries.emp_no = employees.emp_no
)
FROM employees
--LIMIT 100
;

--1b. Same goal as 1a except with a different approach this time...
--1b. Much better efficiency with this solution to question 1!!
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, e.gender, s.salary
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s
ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
;

--2. List employees who were hired in 1986.
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1985-12-31' AND '1986-12-31'

--3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.
SELECT d.dept_no, d.dept_name, m.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, m.from_date, m.to_date 
FROM dept_manager m
JOIN departments d
ON d.dept_no = m.dept_no
JOIN employees e
ON e.emp_no = m.emp_no
;

--4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
SELECT e.emp_no, e.last_name, e.first_name, n.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_emp d
ON d.emp_no = e.emp_no
JOIN departments n
ON d.dept_no = n.dept_no
ORDER BY emp_no
;

--5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name LIKE 'B%';

--6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
--6. Notes: Brute force...effective but inefficient. Oh well...
SELECT * FROM (
	SELECT dept_emp.emp_no, last_name, first_name, dept_name FROM dept_emp
	JOIN departments
	ON departments.dept_no = dept_emp.dept_no
	INNER JOIN employees
	ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
	) AS "results"
WHERE results.dept_name LIKE 'Sales';


--7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
--7. Notes: Same process as above except 2nd matching criteria for Development.
SELECT * FROM (
	SELECT dept_emp.emp_no, last_name, first_name, dept_name FROM dept_emp
	JOIN departments
	ON departments.dept_no = dept_emp.dept_no
	INNER JOIN employees
	ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
	) AS "results"
WHERE results.dept_name LIKE 'Sales' OR results.dept_name LIKE 'Development'
ORDER BY results.dept_name;


--8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
SELECT last_name, count(last_name) AS "#_names" FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY "#_names" DESC;
